Ingenic JZ4770 USB PHY

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "ingenic,jz4770-phy"
- #phy-cells: Must be 0
- clocks: phandle to the PHY clock.
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
- clock-names: Should be "phy"
- vcc-supply: phandle to the VCC power supply
- vbus-supply: phandle to the VBUS power supply

Optional properties:
- extcon : external connector for idpin change detection, needed
           when using dual-role mode.

Example:

otg_extcon: extcon {
	compatible = "linux,extcon-usb-gpio";
	id-gpio = <&gpf 18 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
};

otg_phy: usb-phy@1000003c {
	compatible = "ingenic,jz4770-phy";
	reg = <0x1000003c 0x10>;

	vcc-supply = <&vcc>;
	vbus-supply = <&vbus>;

	clocks = <&cgu JZ4770_CLK_OTG_PHY>;
	clock-names = "otg_phy";

	#phy-cells = <0>;

	extcon = <&otg_extcon>;
};
