* Ingenic JZ47xx auxiliary processor

Inside the Video Processing Unit (VPU) of the recent JZ47xx SoCs from Ingenic
is a second Xburst MIPS CPU very similar to the main core.
This document describes the devicetree bindings for this auxiliary processor.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "ingenic,jz4770-vpu-rproc"
- reg: Must contain the registers location and length for:
  * the auxiliary processor,
  * the Tightly Coupled Shared Memory 0 (TCSM0),
  * the Tightly Coupled Shared Memory 1 (TCSM1),
  * the shared SRAM.
- reg-names: Must contain "aux", "tcsm0", "tcsm1", "sram".
- clocks: Clock specifier for the AUX and VPU clocks.
- clock-names: Must contain "aux", "vpu".
- interrupts: Interrupt specifier for the VPU hardware block.

Example:

vpu: video-decoder@132a0000 {
	compatible = "ingenic,jz4770-vpu-rproc";

	reg = <0x132a0000 0x20 /* AUX */
		   0x132b0000 0x4000 /* TCSM0 */
		   0x132c0000 0xc000 /* TCSM1 */
		   0x132f0000 0x7000 /* SRAM */
	>;
	reg-names = "aux", "tcsm0", "tcsm1", "sram";

	clocks = <&cgu JZ4770_CLK_AUX>, <&cgu JZ4770_CLK_VPU>;
	clock-names = "aux", "vpu";

	interrupt-parent = <&cpuintc>;
	interrupts = <3>;
};
